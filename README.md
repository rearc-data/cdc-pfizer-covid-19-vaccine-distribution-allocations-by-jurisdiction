Weekly first-dose allocations are provided to states on Tuesdays; jurisdictions can begin placing orders on Thursdays. After doses are ordered by states, shipments begin the following Monday. The entire order may not arrive in one shipment or on one day, but over the course of the week. Second doses are opened up for orders on Sundays, at the appropriate interval two or three weeks later according to the manufacturer’s label, with shipments occurring after jurisdictions place orders. Shipments of an FDA-authorized safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine continue to arrive at sites across America. Vaccinations began on December 14, 2020. (Data as of Jan. 12, 2021).
